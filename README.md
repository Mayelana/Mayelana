### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Barbara Mucha and this is my Github profile. I am still very new to this so there isn't much here, but watch this space as it will get inevitably bigger as I cover more stuff!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for Software Development and SQL databases. I hope that one day I will be able to become a Software Engineer or a Web Developer!

My learning to do list for April/May:
- [x] Classes in Python
- [x] Class Inheritance
- [ ] Compositions
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] Django (if I'm lucky to get this far!âœ¨)
